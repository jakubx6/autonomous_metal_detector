# Autonomous metal detector
Area scanning with metal detector mounted on autonomous vehicle.

The project was created for an engineering thesis. It was never completed or properly launched. There is only a full theoretical description and some parts of code. The work is written in Polish.

The subject of the diploma project is designing and building a prototype of an autonomous 
vehicle. This prototype is designed to scan the surface given by the operator, using a metal 
detector, and then send the collected results and present them in the form of a map on a 
computer. The work presents the process of creating a vehicle from design to assembly, 
and description of tests performed and their impact on improving the prototype. As a result, 
a  vehicle  was  created  along  with  the  controlling  algorithm  that  meets  all  the  initial 
assumptions of the project.
